Data:
Note:Two packages of training and validation data sets are given. You can use any package.
eng.train&eng.test(original Conll03 corpus) eng.train.openNLP&eng.test.openNLP(retagging of Conll03 with openNLP,there are many tags that differ from the original Conll03 corpus: estimation at 12% of different tags)

Model:
RNN+CRF:RNNCRFTagger
