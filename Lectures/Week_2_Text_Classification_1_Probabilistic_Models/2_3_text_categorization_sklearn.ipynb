      "\n",
      "Although it would be nice to think that \"an image is an image\",\n",
      "there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\n",
      "different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\n",
      "lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\n",
      "complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded\n",
      "images from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image\n",
      "viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\n",
      "look too light. \"Why is this ?\" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\n",
      "(or the lack of it).\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do we need gamma correction at all ?\n",
      "--------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\n",
      "ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\n",
      "have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\n",
      "image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\n",
      "the scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\n",
      "image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\n",
      "the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\n",
      "and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\n",
      "Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\n",
      "and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you\n",
      "an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\n",
      "coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\n",
      "something like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\n",
      "will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\n",
      "the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\n",
      "will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\n",

      "specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\n",

      "\n",
      "How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\n",

      "to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\n",

      "images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\n",
      "at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\n",
      "way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\n",
      "you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\n",
      "bit.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\n",
      "a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\n",
      "will be above the center.\n",

      "for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\n",
      "gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\n",
      "around 2.2 \n",
      "\n",
      "[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\n",

      "How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\n",
      "true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\n",
      "1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\n",
      "correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\n",
      "(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\n",
      "to some degree or other.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\n",

      "-----------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\n",
      "Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\n",
      "use of the storage medium. This is because the human\n",
      "eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\n",
      "has a similar compression characteristic. This means images \n",
      "could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\n",
      "if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\n",
      "every time you want to do any image processing you should\n",
      "convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\n",
      "the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\n",
      "none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\n",
      "gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\n",
      "images at the popular level.\n",
      "\n",
      "If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\n",
      "and if image manipulation software takes care to use\n",
      "extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\n",
      "then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\n",
      "standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\n",
